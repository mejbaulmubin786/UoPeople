# What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is a discipline("discipline" refers to a systematic and structured approach to solving problems) for solving business problems by designing and developing software-based systems. As with any engineering activity, a software engineer starts with problem definition and applies tools of the trade to obtain a problem solution. However, unlike any other engineering, software engineering seems to require great emphasis on methodology or method for managing the development process, in addition to great skill with tools and techniques.
